<h2>About the Trip</h2>
<p>
This trip with my office colleagues was one of the most refreshing experiences I’ve had.
Over four days we travelled to Gokarna, Honnavara and Murudeshwara along with nearby places.
We enjoyed beaches, long drives, random tea stops and countless laughs.
More than the places, it was the people and memories that made the trip unforgettable.
